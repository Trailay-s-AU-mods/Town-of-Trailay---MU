# Town of Trailay - MU
Town Of Trailay - Modding Us, mod for modding us that add some roles

At the moment it is just an outline, I plan to add some roles to MU

I am still learning C# programming, but when I feel up to it, I will start working on this project

If you are a scripter and would like to help (for free, I don't have money) text me on discord - Trailay #0016
